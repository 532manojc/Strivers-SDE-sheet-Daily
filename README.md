# DSA Daily Practice with C++ üí°

Welcome to the "DSA_daily_with_Cpp" repository, where I embark on a daily journey to enhance my data structures and algorithms skills in C++. Join me in this adventure as I solve questions from various platforms like LeetCode, GeeksForGeeks, and Coding Ninjas.
I'll be solving problems from [Striver's SDE sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/)

## Why this Repository‚ùì

This repository is Created to **Log your Progress daily**, and to motivate the contributors to solve problems **regularly**.
Also there is one more reason to get an idea on how to work with **Git/Github**

## About This Repository üìö

In this repository, you will find a collection of daily problem-solving tasks, each designed to improve my coding skills and understanding of data structures and algorithms. I'll be following Striver's SDE (Software Development Engineer) sheet for DSA, a comprehensive guide to mastering these essential concepts.

## Why Daily Practice? üöÄ

Daily practice is a proven way to enhance your problem-solving skills and grasp complex algorithms. By dedicating time every day to work on coding challenges, I aim to become a more efficient and confident programmer.

## Folder Structure üìÅ

- **Readme.md**: Information about the repository. This also includes solution code of the user for the respective problems.
- **ProgressLog.md**: Daily tracking of Progress. Information about problems which were solved and problems which were attempted
- **[Progress Log]**: Folder having ProgressLog .md of different Contributors.  
- **[Named folders]**: Folders related to different topics which Includes Problems set that contributors solved.
